A Data Analysis Project that Analysed  the sales performance of a Retail Vehicle Sales. The companyâ€™s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.

 I analyzed a retail vehicle sales dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset under review consists of sales records from a retail company that deals in various types of vehicles, including Trains, Vintage Cars, Classic Cars, Motorcycles, Planes, Ships, Trucks, and Buses. The records span from 2003 to 2025 and cover transactions in 22 countries. This analysis aims to provide a preliminary review of the dataset to identify key patterns, trends and provide insights for potential further analysis.

# Geographic and Temporal Sales Analysis
The United States had the highest number of orders, with transactions spanning eight different states. California led in sales among these states
# Insight Identification
From this initial exploration, several insights were immediately observable:
A high completion rate for orders, with most being successfully shipped.
A concentration of sales in the United States, particularly in California.
An identifiable peak in sales activity during 2005.
Classic Cars were in high demand compared to other vehicle types.

# Conclusion
The United States, particularly California, emerged as the leading market. Classic Cars were the most popular vehicle category. Further analysis needs to be done to investigate the factors contributing to the peak sales in 2003 and 2004 and the reduction in sales in 2005. We need to examine customer demographics and purchasing patterns to identify key customer segments.
